<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>During the last decade, Next Generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized basic, applied, and clinical research. This IndyUseR tutorial is a brief overview, covering the basics of RNA-seq experimental planning and data analysis. The bulk of the analysis will focus on analyses that occur once a gene expression count matrix is obtained. We will cover quality control, differential gene expression analysis, pathway analysis, enrichment analysis, and data visualization.</p>

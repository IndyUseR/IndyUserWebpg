<p>We discussed plans for 2019. We had sent a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Atha7ak8Oasn_RTqlKK5ROejnai8by4L8-vOk6UXpAE/edit">survey</a> to the folks in IndyUseR meetup group (~400 members). We got only 13 responses. We reviewed the responses and factored those into our discussions. The summary of the 13 responses are in this <a href="https://indyuser.github.io/IndyUserWebpg/presentationFiles/jan2019/IndyUserSurvey.html">location</a>.</p>
<p>We discussed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have zoom meetings for the meetups so that folks can join online and location is less of a barrier</li>
<li>Try to have meeting topics confirmed well before the meetup date</li>
<li>Talked about having intro level talks to make the group welcoming to new R users</li>
<li>Talked about bringing back R trivia segment for each of the meetups</li>
<li>Will look into a R Training day</li>
</ul>

<h2>Topics of Interest:</h2>
<p>Some of the topics of interest listed in this yearâ€™s survey and talked about last year are listed in this <a href="https://github.com/IndyUseR/Meetings/issues/4">location</a>. Others can add to the list. It would also be great if anybody who is familiar with one of these topics volunteers to present to the group.</p>

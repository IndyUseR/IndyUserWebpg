<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The job of a data engineer is to build, manage, and optimize systems for transforming data into forms that facilitate analysis. Despite the broad adoption of R as a language for data science, it has taken a back seat to Python and other languages in the area of data engineering. But this is beginning to change. Data engineering tasks that were previously infeasible in R are becoming straightforward thanks to recent developments in the Apache Arrow project and the R package <code>arrow</code>. Arrow provides tools for working with tabular data that emphasize performance, efficiency, standardization, and interoperability with other languages and systems in the broader data ecosystem. Using the R package <code>arrow</code>, it is now possible to implement many data engineering and ETL tasks entirely in R, avoiding the overhead of switching to another language Python or using a framework like Spark.</p>

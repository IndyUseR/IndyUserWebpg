      <description>Abstract Lance introduced us to the R package named golem, which can be used to create production-grade Shiny applications. If you are into R based web application development and Shiny, this framework may be your guide to keeping your code organized with it’s embedded best practices.
Lance graciously agreed to do this meetup session for us at extremely short notice. So there were a few hiccups during the live demo. But he agreed to do another recording after the meetup to showcase Golem again which went more smoothly.</description>

      <guid>/IndyUserWebpg/2019/11/19/nov2019/</guid>
      <description>Abstract During the last decade, Next Generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized basic, applied, and clinical research. This IndyUseR tutorial is a brief overview, covering the basics of RNA-seq experimental planning and data analysis. The bulk of the analysis will focus on analyses that occur once a gene expression count matrix is obtained. We will cover quality control, differential gene expression analysis, pathway analysis, enrichment analysis, and data visualization.

      <title>Reproducible workflows at scale with Drake - Will Landau</title>
      <link>/IndyUserWebpg/2019/10/15/oct2019/</link>

      <guid>/IndyUserWebpg/2019/10/15/oct2019/</guid>
      <description>Abstract Ambitious workflows in R, such as machine learning analyses, can be difficult to manage. A single round of computation can take several hours to complete, and routine updates to the code and data tend to invalidate hard-earned results. You can enhance the maintainability, hygiene, speed, scale, and reproducibility of such projects with the drake R package. drake resolves the dependency structure of your analysis pipeline, skips tasks that are already up to date, executes the rest with optional distributed computing, and organizes the output so you rarely have to think about data files.</description>

      <title>Explore Simmer Package for Discrete Event Simulation in R</title>
      <link>/IndyUserWebpg/2019/05/21/may2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/IndyUserWebpg/2019/05/21/may2019/</guid>
      <description>Abstract Discrete event simulation is a powerful approach to model real life processes that consist of a sequence of discrete events. An example of such system is queue in a coffee shop. We will explore the package simmer and work through some examples from the vignettes to learn how simmer can be used for doing discrete event simulation in R.

      <title>Creating (Web) Maps with R - Stephen Roecker</title>

      <guid>/IndyUserWebpg/2019/04/16/apr2019/</guid>
      <description>Abstract Most data has a spatial dimension to it. Knowing ‘where’ the data is coming from is often as crucial as knowing the ‘what’, ‘when’ and ‘who’ dimensions of a given dataset. Therefore it should be no surprise that R has a rich suite of packages for constructing maps and analyzing spatial data. R’s capability has grown so much over the years that it’s functionality rivals many dedicated geographic information systems (GIS).</description>

      <description>We discussed plans for 2019. We had sent a survey to the folks in IndyUseR meetup group (~400 members). We got only 13 responses. We reviewed the responses and factored those into our discussions. The summary of the 13 responses are in this location.
We discussed the following:
 Have zoom meetings for the meetups so that folks can join online and location is less of a barrier Try to have meeting topics confirmed well before the meetup date Talked about having intro level talks to make the group welcoming to new R users Talked about bringing back R trivia segment for each of the meetups Will look into a R Training day  Topics of Interest: Some of the topics of interest listed in this year’s survey and talked about last year are listed in this location.</description>

      <description>Abstract We will be discussing time series group forecasting in R as well as ggvis visualization. Forecasting is always a topic of importance with the availability of several models such as ARIMA, seasonal decomposition, exponential smoothing and so on. Each and every method produces different or close to similar output based on the data we use. We will be going through a hands on forecast modelling in R using Tidyverse and MAPA package.</description>

      <description>Derrick covered the topic of turning Analysis into an API with Plumber. The abstract of the talk and link to presented material are below.
Abstract You’ve imported the data, cleaned it up, and built the model. Your next step is to communicate your findings with others. Typically this would mean writing a report or building a web application so other people could visualize how the model works, but sometime your Communicate step is someone else’s Import step.</description>
